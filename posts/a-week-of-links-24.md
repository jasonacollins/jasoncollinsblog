Links this week:



	
  1. The Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization has a special issue out “[Evolution as a General Theoretical Framework for Economics and Public Policy](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01672681/90/supp/S)”. You can also access the papers through [the Evolution Institute website](http://evolution-institute.org/jebo) and there is a series of [summary articles in Evolution: This View of Life](http://www.thisviewoflife.com/index.php/magazine/articles/evolution-and-economics-special-issue). Many look worth a read, and I'll post about them over coming weeks/months.

	
  2. David Sloan Wilson (one of the editors and authors in the JEBO special issue above) has an [article in aeon magazine ](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/living-together/how-evolution-can-reform-economics/)critiquing economics from an evolutionary angle.

	
  3. Also in aeon magazine, [an interesting take on obesity](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/being-human/david-berreby-obesity-era/) (HT: [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/health/obesity-complexity-2013.html)). It's fair to say that a simple "calorie in-calorie out" analysis doesn't cut the mustard anymore. (But I don't buy the bit about lab animal food staying the same).

	
  4. Another article from Evolution: This View of Life that is worth a look - [Daniel Hruschka on collectivism versus individualism](http://www.thisviewoflife.com/index.php/magazine/articles/1094/infections-institutions-and-life-histories-searching-for-the-origins-of-ind).

	
  5. Support for [Gregory Clark's argument](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/social-mobility-across-the-generations/) that analysis of social mobility over a single generation overestimates its extent - a [child's socioeconomic position is determined by their grandparents](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-23101446), not just their parents (blog post on this article to come soon).

	
  6. [Britain is undergoing a baby boom](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10155449/Britains-baby-boom-will-affect-our-economy-more-than-anything-Mark-Carney-does.html). I [expect this will be a common developed country observation](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/fertility-is-going-to-go-up/) over the next decade.
