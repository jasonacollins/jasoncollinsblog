Links this week:

	
  1. [Cooperation in humans versus apes](http://nautil.us/issue/18/genius/cooperation-is-what-makes-us-human-rd).

	
  2. [In praise of pilots](http://timharford.com/2014/10/why-pilot-schemes-help-ideas-take-flight/).

	
  3. [Are women better decision makers](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/opinion/sunday/are-women-better-decision-makers.html)?

	
  4. [Amazon is doing us a favour. Goodbye book publishers](http://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/7016827/amazon-hachette-monopoly).

	
  5. [The logic of failure](http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2014/10/the-logic-of-failure/).

	
  6. [The Behavioural Insights Team has lunch with Walter Mischel](http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/blogpost/lunch-walter). Mischel'sÂ work is fantastic and his new book is on my reading list, but the mention of brain plasticity and epigenetics (in the same sentence!) has reduced my expectations.
