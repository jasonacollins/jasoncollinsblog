From a [new article in HBR](https://hbr.org/2025/11/how-behavioral-science-can-improve-the-return-on-ai-investments) on using behavioural science when rolling out AI tools:

> Consider building an AI transcription tool. It would be reasonable for designers to assume that the most seamless interface is always best. But [behavioral research](https://doi.org/10.1177/1088868309341564) shows that intentionally adding a little friction—e.g., displaying words in harder-to-read font—actually helps people scrutinize the text more closely, which helps them find and correct errors.

This classic paper on this point is by Adam Alter and friends [-@alter2007].[^1] In Experiment 1, Alter et al. report on an experiment where they gave student volunteers the cognitive reflection test, which comprises questions such as:

[^1]: This wasn't the paper linked from the HBR article. The link is to a review on disfluency by Alter and Daniel M. Oppenheimer [-@alter2009]. Within that review, the claim about hard to read fonts comes from the Alter et al. [-@alter2007]paper I have just discussed.

> A bat and a ball cost \$1.10 in total. The bat costs \$1.00 more than the ball.
>
> How much does the ball cost? \_\_\_\_\_ cents

The questions typically have an intuitive, wrong answer and a correct answer that requires a little more thought.

Alter and friends split the experimental participants into two conditions. Some participants were given the questions in an easy-to-read font, others in a hard-to-read font. And as suggested in the HBR article, those who were given the questions in the disfluent font answer more questions correctly. Sixty five percent of participants in the disfluent group got all questions correct, compared to only 10 percent in the fluent condition.

The paper has a series of other similar experiment in which they show that disfluency can trigger more analytical forms of reasoning, sometimes correcting the errors of intuition.

This all sounds good until we examine the follow-up studies that have come in since.

@thompson2013 ran a series of experiments, including two involving the cognitive reflection test, and found no effect on accuracy. They did suggest there might be an effect among the highest-IQ participants, but nothing in aggregate.

I've been [beating this drum](bad-behavioural-science-failures-bias-and-fairy-tales.md) for almost 10 years now. And sadly it still needs beating.
