The folks at [ideas42](http://ideas42.org/), the [Center for Decision Research](https://research.chicagobooth.edu/cdr/), and the [Behavioral Science and Policy Association](https://behavioralpolicy.org/) have kicked off a new online magazine, [The Behavioral Scientist](http://behavioralscientist.org/).

I am one of the founding columnists, and it looks like I am part of a [pretty good line up](http://behavioralscientist.org/columnists/). My first column should appear in late July.

You can sign up to the Behavioral Scientist email edition on the [homepage](http://behavioralscientist.org/), or follow on [twitter](https://twitter.com/behscientist).

As an aside, I've been quiet on the blogging front recently, but contemplating article ideas for The Behavioral Scientist has reminded me how important blogging is for the development of my thinking. So expect to see a higher frequency of posts over the next few months.
