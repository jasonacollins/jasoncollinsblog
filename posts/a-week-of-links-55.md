Links this week:
	
  1. There are plenty of reviews of Nicholas Wade's new book, *A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History*. [Robert VerBruggen](http://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2014/05/06/race_is_real_what_does_that_mean_for_society_108642.html)'s is one of the more interesting. We'll be throwing a lot of social science under the bus if we apply [Andrew Gelman's filter](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/05/troublesome_inheritance_critique_nicholas_wade_s_dated_assumptions_about.html) more generally.

	
  2. [Gelman again](http://andrewgelman.com/2014/05/08/discussion-steven-pinker-research-attached-data-noisy-essentially-uninformative/), this time on poor research in evolutionary psychology. I agree with both him and Pinker here.

	
  3. A review of [Think Like a Freak](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-05-08/book-review-think-like-a-freak-by-steven-levitt-and-stephen-dubner). From the excerpts I have seen, it seems that Levitt and Dubner are running into the same problem as a lot of the behavioural economics literature - there are only so many "funky" stories to go around.

	
  4. [Can a single gene explain 3 per cent of the variation in IQ](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21601809-potent-source-genetic-variation-cognitive-ability-has-just-been)? I don't think so, but interesting none the less.
