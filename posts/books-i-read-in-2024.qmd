The books I enjoyed the most in 2024, although all were published in different years:

- Ashlee Vance, *When the Heavens Went on Sale*: For all the grumbling about how progress in software isn't matched in the physical world, Vance tells some amazing stories. The tale about how Planet Labs got going using smartphone technology to make shoebox size satellites was fantastic.
- Julia Galef, *The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don't*: Wonderfully practical. I enter almost every psychology or behavioural science related book dreading the shaky scientific studies I will be dragged through. But Galef did a great job of knowing when to pull out a study (not often) and when to build a more practical case.
- William Poundstone, *Fortune's Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street*: A good balance of technicality and colour.
- Kurt Vonnnegut, *Player Piano*: Simply a great story.

Below is the list of books I read in 2024 (with a star if I have read them before). My volume of my reading of books cover-to-cover has increased from 2023, with 49 total (26 non-fiction, 23 fiction).
