Better late than never....

The best books I <em>read</em> in 2019 - generally released in other years - are below. Where I have reviewed, the link leads to that review (not many reviews this year).

- Nick Chater, [_The Mind is Flat_](/nick-chaters-the-mind-is-flat-the-illusion-of-mental-depth-and-the-improvised-mind/): A great book in which Chater argues that there are no ‘hidden depths’ to our minds.

- Stephan Guyenet, _The Hungry Brain: Outsmarting the Instincts that Make us Overeat_: Excellent summary of modern nutrition research and how the body "regulates" its weight.

- Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider, _The Financial Diaries: How American Families Cope in a World of Uncertainty_: I find a lot of value reading about the world outside of my bubble. I learnt a lot from this book.

- Paul Seabright, _The Company of Strangers_: An excellent exploration of the evolutionary foundations of cooperation. A staple of my [evolutionary biology and economics reading list](/economics-and-evolutionary-biology-reading-list/).

- Lenore Skenazy, _Free-Range Kids: How to Raise Safe, Self-Reliant Children (Without Going Nuts with Worry)_: A fun read of some wise advice.

- M Mitchell Waldrop, _The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal_: A bit too much detail, but a worthwhile story about the origins of personal computing. Many of the concepts about human-machine interaction remain relevant today.

Below is the full list of books that I read in 2019 (with links where reviewed and starred if a re-read). The volume of my reading declined year-on-year again, with 61 books total (40 non-fiction, 21 fiction). Most of that decline came in the back half of the year when I spent a lot of time reading and researching around some narrow academic topics. 45 of the below were read before June. I could add a lot of children's books to the list (especially Enid Blyton), but I'll leave those aside.
