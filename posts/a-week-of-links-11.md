Links this week:



	
  1. There are plenty of good looking MOOCs popping up. John Hawks [has announced](http://johnhawks.net/courses/mooc/hawks-mooc-first-announcement-2013.html) his MOOC [Human Evolution: Past and Future](https://www.coursera.org/course/humanevolution), starting early 2014. Dan Ariely's [behavioural economics course](https://www.coursera.org/course/behavioralecon) kicked off a couple of weeks ago, and this [course on social and economic networks](https://www.coursera.org/course/networksonline) by Matthew Jackson looks worth a look. I seem to be adopting a speed learning strategy for MOOCs - wait until all the material is up and then binge.

	
  2. How will the [Flynn effect](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/flynns-are-we-getting-smarter/) and the [bright tax](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-bright-tax/) balance out? We're [looking OK until 2042](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000068).

	
  3. [Slavery and capitalism](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/king-cottons-long-shadow).
