Yesterday was the second edition of the [Marketing Science Ideas Xchange (MSiX)](http://www.msix.com.au/). It was a more eclectic set of speakers than last year, extending from the first year's behavioural economics focus to include neuroscience and "big data". In my mind, the increased variety worked well.

If you saw [yesterday's post](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/please-not-another-bias-an-evolutionary-take-on-behavioural-economics/), I spoke at the event and provided a reading list which included Matt Ridley's *The Red Queen*, Geoffrey Miller's [Spent](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/millers-spent-sex-evolution-and-consumer-behavior/), Gad Saad's [The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/saads-the-evolutionary-bases-of-consumption/) and *The Consuming Instinct*, Amotz Zahavi's *The Handicap Principle*, Robert Frank’s[ Luxury Fever](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/franks-luxury-fever/), Gerd Gigerenzer’s [Rationality for Mortals](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/gerd-gigerenzers-rationality-for-mortals-how-people-cope-with-uncertainty/) and Douglas Kendrick and Vlad Griskevicus's [The Rational Animal](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/kenrick-and-griskeviciuss-the-rational-animal/).

From the other presentations, I didn't record all the books as they were mentioned, but here are the main titles that I can recall:

Michael Norton's *Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending*

Suzanne Mettler's *The Submerged State: How Invisible Government Policies Undermine American Democracy*

Robert Cialdini's *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion*

Clayton Christensen's *The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book That Will Change the Way You Do Business*

Andrew Leigh's *The Economics of Just About Everything*

Byron Sharp's *How Brands Grow: What Marketers Don't Know*

Adam Ferrier's *The Advertising Effect: How to Change Behaviour*

Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's [Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/thaler-and-sunsteins-nudge/)

James Hurman's *The Case for Creativity* (which seems to have drifted out of print)
