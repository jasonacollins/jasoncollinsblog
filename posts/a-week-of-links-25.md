Links this week:



	
  1. [Eric Falkenstein on Stevenson and Wolfers's happiness research](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/07/stevenson-and-wolfers-flawed-happiness.html). "When an economist tells you a symmetric ovoid contains a highly significant trend via the power of statistics, don't believe them".

	
  2. Australia's Productivity Commission has [fingered genetics as a cause of differences in educational attainment](http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/124549/deep-persistent-disadvantage.pdf). It's healthy that ideas such as this are starting to be mentioned in serious discussion (although the Commission still treats the issue as though it is walking on eggshells).

	
  3. [Rory Sutherland suggests](http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/the-wiki-man/8940221/why-politics-needs-more-darwinists-and-fewer-economists/) we need more Darwinists, fewer economists. Read the last paragraph.

	
  4. [Diane Coyle reviews](http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2013/07/putting-people-in-economic-theory/) An Economic Theory of Greed, Love, Groups and Networks. I've started reading it and will review myself in the next few weeks.

	
  5. The UK's [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends](http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/news/ConsiderLowerBMIRiskThresholdsPeopleBlackAsianMinorityGroups.jsp) adjusting BMI recommendations by ethnicity.
