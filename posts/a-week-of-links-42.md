Links this week:



	
  1. [David Dobbs takes on the Selfish Gene](http://aeon.co/magazine/nature-and-cosmos/why-its-time-to-lay-the-selfish-gene-to-rest/). [Dawkins responds](http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation_articles/2013/12/6/adversarial-journalism-and-the-selfish-gene#) ([as does Jerry Coyne](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/david-dobbs-mucks-up-evolution-part-i/), [three](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/12/06/david-dobbs-mucks-up-evoution-part-ii/) [times](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/12/06/dawkins-responds-to-dobbs/)). I'm generally with Dawkins and Coyne on the theme (if not every detail) of this argument. I'd go as far to say that I wish the selfish gene concept would make a comeback in some areas.

	
  2. Martin Nowak and E.O Wilson, this time with Ben Allen, have launched another broadside at inclusive fitness. [Allen posts on the paper](http://plektix.fieldofscience.com/2013/12/whats-deal-with-inclusive-fitness-theory.html) (and if anyone can point me to any commentary on the paper, it would be appreciated - it seems a bit quiet compared to Nowak and Wilson's paper with Tarnita).

	
  3. A new journal - [Cosmos & Taxis: Studies in Emergent Order and Organization](http://www.sfu.ca/cosmosandtaxis.html) - has launched. The [first issue](http://www.sfu.ca/cosmosandtaxis/current-issue.html) is available.


Otherwise, I'm now back from holidays and almost over some tropical fever I managed to pick up, so regular blogging should recommence in the next few days.
