The [preliminary program](http://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2013conference/program/preliminary.php) for January's American Economic Association annual meeting is available, with a session dedicated to genoeconomics. I've posted on [the first of the papers before](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-genetic-architecture-of-economic-and-political-preferences/).

Evolutionary biology also gets a slot in the session on the historical origins of comparative development:

Genetic Diversity and Ethnic Civil Conflict
CEMAL EREN ARBATLI (Brown University)
QUAMRUL ASHRAF (Williams College)
ODED GALOR (Brown University)</blockquote>


This paper might be an interesting addition to the debate about [Ashraf and Galor's paper on genetic diversity and economic development](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/harvard-academics-on-genetic-diversity-and-economic-development/). The potential for conflict due to higher levels of genetic diversity is half of their argument for a hump-shaped relationship between genetic diversity and economic development, and it could do with some support.
