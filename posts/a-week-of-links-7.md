Links this week:

1. [Andrew Berry guest blogs](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/guest-post-the-most-poignant-episode-in-all-of-the-history-of-science/) at Why Evolution is True on Alfred Russel Wallace's unfortunate end to his Amazon expedition. The equivalent of accidentally erasing your PhD thesis the day before submission?
	
2. I am enjoying some of the press coming out about Marlene Zuk's new book Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We Live (and the reactions to it); this week [an interview in the Los Angeles Review of Books](http://lareviewofbooks.org/interview/evolution-sex-and-finding-your-inner-grok-an-interview-with-marlene-zuk).
	
3. An [interview with Gary Becker](http://ejpe.org/pdf/5-1-int.pdf) on rationality, behavioural economics and the use of mathematics in economics.
	
4. [A profile of Ingela Alger](http://www.tseconomist.com/1/post/2013/01/-links-between-economics-and-biology-ingela-alger.html), another economist looking to bring some evolutionary biology into the picture.
