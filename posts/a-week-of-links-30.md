Links this week:



	
  1. [Sean Roberts on spurious correlations over at Replicated Typo](http://www.replicatedtypo.com/uncovering-spurious-correlations-between-language-and-culture/6396.html).

	
  2. [Some babble on the neuroscience bubble](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/bursting-the-neuro-utopian-bubble/?_r=0).

	
  3. [Why do Jews succeed](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-do-jews-succeed-)? [Noah Smith throws some reasons out there](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/08/how-successful-are-jews-really.html), but I expect Smith's explanations would do a poor job of explaining ultra-success in the form of, say, Nobel prizes. And here's [Noah Millman's take](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/millman/fighting-bigotry-without-political-correctness/).

	
  4. And finally, below, an interview with Leda Cosmides (HT: [Douglas Kenrick](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201308/interview-leda-cosmides)).
