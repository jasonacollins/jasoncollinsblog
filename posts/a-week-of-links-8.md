Links this week:
	
  1. [Razib Kahn encourages academics](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/03/why-more-academics-should-blog-cuz-you-can/) to get on the blogging bandwagon (and, [my post](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/why-i-blog/) on my experience).

	
  2. [David Barash on "evolutionary existentialism"](http://chronicle.com/article/EvolutionExistentialism/137715/), my favourite piece this week.

	
  3. Paleo or not, [we all get heart disease](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/science/earth/ct-scans-find-vascular-disease-in-ancient-mummies.html?_r=0). Also on the paleo front, [Peter Turchin reviews](http://socialevolutionforum.com/2013/03/10/starving-the-enemy/) Paul and Shou-Ching Jaminet's *Perfect Health Diet*; and [John Hawks reviews](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/books/paleofantasy-zuk-2013.html) Marlene Zuk's [Paleofantasy](/zuks-paleofantasy/).

	
  4. I've spent a lot of time over the last year or two reading material on Nowak, Tarnita and Wilson's paper [The Evolution of Eusociality](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09205), the trigger for the latest round of the group selection wars. It might be a couple of years old, but this [excellent discussion by Chris Jensen](http://www.christopherxjjensen.com/2010/10/13/robert-trivers-and-colleagues-on-nowak-tarnita-and-wilsons-the-evolution-of-eusociality/) is the most useful I have found. Jensen also blogs on Nowak's work [here](http://www.christopherxjjensen.com/2011/08/03/martin-nowak-lecture-on-the-evolution-of-cooperation-at-mit/).
