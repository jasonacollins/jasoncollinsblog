Links this week:



	
  1. David Sloan Wilson and Jonathan Haidt have kicked off [an evolution and business blog at Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/darwinatwork/). It will be worth a read, and unsurprisingly [the first post](http://www.forbes.com/sites/darwinsbusiness/2013/09/05/sears-ignores-the-invisible-band/) reflects Wilson and Haidt's group selection leanings. It should give plenty of fodder for interesting posts. I've written about [Haidt's group selection views before](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/haidts-group-selection/), plus plenty of posts on Wilson's ([here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/economic-cosmology-the-rational-egotistical-individual/) and [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/economic-cosmology-the-invisible-hand/) for starters).


	
  2. Also on Jonathan Haidt, [he is the editor of a new business section](http://www.thisviewoflife.com/index.php/magazine/articles/welcome-to-the-new-business-section) at Evolution: This View of Life.

	
  3. A book that looks worth a read: [The Rational Animal](http://rationalanimalbook.com/). [Doug Kenrick posts on it](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201308/are-you-smarter-you-think).

	
  4. [Tim Harford's article on Lin Ostrom's work](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/afc5377e-1026-11e3-a258-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2dUvfRkUI) is good. Ostrom gets quoted a lot for her suggestion that a single international agreement to deal with climate change would be a mistake, less so for her suggestion of polycentric action at all levels - just the sort of thing that would have the typical economist decrying as horribly inefficient.
