Links this week:

	
  1. [A conversation with Rory Sutherland](http://edge.org/conversation/this-thing-for-which-we-have-no-name). Many good pieces, but my favourite line:

>Certainly there's a problem with numbers in that there are sophisticated things in life that we all understand perfectly well when verbally described. Should psychology be constrained by math? I mean, who has the better understanding of human behaviorâ€”Shakespeare or Eugene Fama? If you make mathematical expression a barrier to entry, to any kind of theory, you are undoubtedly limiting yourselves.

  1. [Another article taking a shot at the idea that "all calories are equal"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/opinion/sunday/always-hungry-heres-why.html?smid=tw-nytimes&_r=0).

	
  2. [A not so glowing review](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/15/think-like-a-freak-freakonomics-levitt-dubner-review) of the latest book in the Freakonomics franchise - *Think Like a Freak*. [Noah Smith also takes a shot](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/market-priesthood.html).
	
  3. Two good pieces on the mess that is copyright protection - [an extended riff on barriers to innovation](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-party-of-innovation/) and [the ridiculous length of copyright terms](http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/absurdities-of-copyright-protection.html).
