  2. Another [Andrew Gelman swipe](http://themonkeycage.org/2013/05/30/more-on-those-psychological-science-papers-menstrual-cycles-and-political-attitudes-biceps-size-and-political-attitudes/) at those "Psychological Science"papers.

	
  3. From late last year, but worth a read - John S Wilkins [takes a look at sociobiology](http://evolvingthoughts.net/2012/12/eww-i-stepped-in-some-evolutionary-psychology-and-other-crap/) (Parts [1](evolvingthoughts.net/2012/12/evopsychopathy-1-conditions-for-sociobiology/), [2](http://evolvingthoughts.net/2012/12/evopsychopathy-2-the-phylogenetic-bracket/), [3](http://evolvingthoughts.net/2012/12/evopsychopathy-3-the-explanatory-target/) and [4](http://evolvingthoughts.net/2012/12/evopsychopathy-4-adaptive-scenarios/) follow) [HT: [Ã…se Kvist Innes-Ker](http://asefixesscience.wordpress.com/)].
