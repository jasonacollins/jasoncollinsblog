Links this week:






	
  1. [Does public policy promote obesity](http://www.cato-unbound.org/2015/01/16/baylen-linnekin/does-public-policy-promote-obesity)? This month's [Cato Unbound on whether public policy can stop obesity](http://www.cato-unbound.org/issues/january-2015/can-public-policy-stop-obesity) could be interesting when the discussion begins, but the response essays so far have generally talked past each other.

	
  2. Three links via [Tyler Cowen](https://twitter.com/tylercowen). [New cars fake their engine noise](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/americas-best-selling-cars-and-trucks-are-built-on-lies-the-rise-of-fake-engine-noise/2015/01/21/6db09a10-a0ba-11e4-b146-577832eafcb4_story.html?hpid=z2). [People turn down high-cost low-value treatments when they can pocket part of the savings](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/01/is-the-split-benefit-a-feasible-way-to-reduce-health-care-costs.html). [The right won the economics debate; left and right are just haggling over details](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/01/good-sentences-from-nick-rowe.html).

	
  3. [The Dunning-Kruger Peak of Advertising](http://www.warc.com/Blogs/The_DunningKruger_Peak_of_Advertising.blog?ID=1998).

	
  4. [Chickens prefer beautiful humans](http://cogprints.org/5272/1/ghirlanda_jansson_enquist2002.pdf). So much for the subjectivity of beauty.

	
  5. [Default retirement savings in Illinois](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/upshot/illinois-introduces-automatic-retirement-savings-program-a-first-for-the-nation.html?_r=1&abt=0002&abg=0).
