Links this week:



	
  1. Aaron Sell [rants about](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-entertainment/201308/is-why-conservatives-don-t-believe-in-global-warming) some recent papers on whether there are sex differences in the willingness to have casual sex.

	
  2. Robert Kurzban (who I seem to be linking to a lot recently) [posts on one of my favourite Gerd Gigerenzer papers](http://www.epjournal.net/blog/2013/08/theories-in-psychology-a-gigerenzian-view/).

	
  3. [Alex Tabarrok comments on fat animals](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/08/the-animals-are-also-getting-fat.html).

	
  4. ["Derek" fathers over 500 children filling in for shellshocked husbands](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2383895/Desperate-wives-man-fathered-500-children-women-war-hero-husbands-shellshocked-make-love.html).

	
  5. [Do we need more pharmaceutical advertising to enhance the placebo effect](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/07/17/1012818110.abstract)?

	
  6. Finally, after catching some tweets about Iain Couzin's talk at [Behaviour 2013](http://iec2013.com/), I was perusing [his website](http://icouzin.princeton.edu/) and found a lot of interesting bits and pieces, including the below video. I'm convinced that work on herding and swarming has a lot to offer economics (as [Andrew Oswald argues](http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/videoAndAudio/channels/publicLecturesAndEvents/player.aspx?id=1270)).
