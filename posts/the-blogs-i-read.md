Although [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) seems to be on the way out, I've found myself explaining feed readers to a few people recently. They asked for some suggestions of blogs to follow, so below are some from my reading list.

I try not to live in a bubble, but you can see a libertarian bent to these recommendations. My full reading list (as at 4 January 2015) is [here](/file/feedly-20150104-opml1.zip) - unzip and upload it into your favourite feed reader - and is a bit broader than the below might suggest.

[Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://andrewgelman.com/): My favourite blog. Regularly skewers statistical papers of all types. I've learnt more about the practical use of statistics from Andrew Gelman than I have in any statistics or econometrics class.

[Offsetting Behaviour](http://www.offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.com): Eric Crampton's regular dismantling of those who want to protect us from ourselves is always worth reading.

[Gene Expression](https://www.gnxp.com/): Still the best evolutionary biology and genetics blog.

[Bleeding Heart Libertarians](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/): The blog at which I feel most at home politically.

[Econlog](http://econlog.econlib.org/): I have only Bryan Caplan's posts in my feed, although Caplan is possibly the most infuriating thinker I regularly read.

[Askblog](http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/): Arnold Kling's post-Econlog blog is always a source of sharp comment on interesting material.

[Marginal Revolution](http://marginalrevolution.com/): One of the most popular economics sites, but possibly the best aggregator of interesting content.

[Econtalk](http://www.econtalk.org/): Not a blog but a podcast. Russ Roberts has an impressive guest list and is rarely dull. There is a massive back catalogue worth working through.

[Club Troppo](http://clubtroppo.com.au/): A centrist Australian political blog. I don't have any Australian "libertarian" or "free market" blogs in my feed, as they are generally horrible - conservative at best (rare), corporatist at worst, with posts closer to trolling than informative and comment sections that make the eyes bleed.

[Information Processing](http://infoproc.blogspot.com.au/): Stephen Hsu provides plenty of material at the cutting edge of research into genetics and intelligence.

[Santa Fe Institute News](http://www.santafe.edu/news/): The best feed of complexity related stories and ideas.

[Matt Ridley's Blog](http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog): Hit and miss (a bit like [The Rational Optimist](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/ridleys-the-rational-optimist/)), but more than enough good material.

[The Enlightened Economist](http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/): A constant source of additions to my book reading list.
