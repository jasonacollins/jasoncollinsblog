Links this week:






	
  1. [The workplace is needed to overcome our lack of self control](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/upshot/looking-at-productivity-as-a-state-of-mind.html).

	
  2. [Resisting instant gratification - the FT explores Walter Mischel's the Marshmallow Test](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8bc0b116-43fe-11e4-8abd-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3F8HAZpjs).

	
  3. Most critiques of twin studies recycle the same discredited 40-year-old arguments. [Here's another paper pulling them apart](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12049/abstract).

	
  4. [The college educated are still getting married, just later. The same can't be said for everyone else](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marriage-isnt-dead-yet/).

	
  5. [A critique of the 10,000 hour rule](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/09/malcolm_gladwell_s_10_000_hour_rule_for_deliberate_practice_is_wrong_genes.2.html). But people should not feel obliged to follow every mention of the role of genetics with an apology for war, slavery and genocide (surprised eugenics didn't get a mention).

	
  6. [People respond to prices on medical procedures](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/upshot/given-choice-parents-pick-cheaper-medical-procedure-for-children.html?_r=0&abt=0002&abg=1). Demand curves still slope down.

	
  7. [Your baby looks like your ex](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/02/baby-looks-like-ex-research?CMP=twt_gu). Slightly disturbing.

	
  8. [A collection of W. Brian Arthur papers on complexity in economics is due out at the end of the month](http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/brian-arthur-book-release-complexity-economy/).

	
  9. [Matt Ridley reviews Steven Johnson's book How We Got To Now](http://rationaloptimist.com/blog/how-we-got-to-now-%281%29.aspx).

	
  10. [Neuroskeptic skewers claims that "this will change your brain"](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2014/09/21/warning-this-will-change-your-brain/).

	
  11. [Young, middle-aged and old men all want women in their 20s](http://time.com/3433014/men-women-dating-mid-20s/). But [they're realistic about what they can get](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201409/sex-lies-and-big-data).

	
  12. [Academics writing stinks](http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Academics-Writing-Stinks/148989?cid=megamenu).

	
  13. [French regulators are mad](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7467c02a-41e9-11e4-b98f-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3EZCPZ4ui). Or at least a touch madder than the rest.
