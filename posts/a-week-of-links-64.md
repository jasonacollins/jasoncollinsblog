Links this week:






	
  1. [Side effect warnings increase sales by building trust](http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterubel/2014/08/18/side-effect-warnings-can-increase-pharmaceutical-sales/).[ Similar effects for disclosing conflicts of interest](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.101.3.423) ([ungated pdf](http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/PitfallsdisclosingCOI.pdf)).

	
  2. [Absorbing information on paper versus kindle](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/19/readers-absorb-less-kindles-paper-study-plot-ereader-digitisation). Even without digital search, I often find it easier to find favourite passages in the physical form.

	
  3. [Humans aren't the only ones fighting wars](http://socialevolutionforum.com/2014/08/18/the-war-over-war-part-ii/).

	
  4. I pointed out a couple of weeks ago that Geoffrey Miller had joined forces with Tucker Max to give sex and dating advice. [Their reading list is very good](http://www.thematinggrounds.com/books/), even if you're not after any advice. [Their suggestions as to which movies might provide insight](http://www.thematinggrounds.com/movies/) is quite amusing.

	
  5. [Twin research](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/twins-a-gold-mine-for-research/378697/).
