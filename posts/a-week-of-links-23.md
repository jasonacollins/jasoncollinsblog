Links this week:
	
  1. If you read one thing this week, read this article by Enrico Spolaore and Romain Wacziarg: [How Deep Are the Roots of Economic Development?](http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jel.51.2.325) (ungated version [here](http://sites.tufts.edu/enricospolaore/files/2012/08/RootsF.pdf)). I'll post in more detail on the article in a couple of weeks.

	
  2. [Noah Smith provides a list](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/06/some-essential-papers-in-behavioral.html) of essential papers in behavioural finance.

	
  3. [Cannabis and IQ](http://andrewgelman.com/2013/06/22/struggles-over-the-criticism-of-the-cannabis-users-and-iq-change-paper/).

	
  4. My newest working paper has just gone online: [Population, Technological Progress and the Evolution of Innovative Potential](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/population-technological-progress-and-the-evolution-of-innovative). I'll post about it sometime next week. [Post is now [up here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/population-technological-progress-and-the-evolution-of-innovative-potential/)]
