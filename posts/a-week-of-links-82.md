Links this week:
	
  1. [Lectures on Human Capital by Gary Becker](https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9334868E7A821E2A). (HT: [Eric Crampton](https://twitter.com/EricCrampton))

	
  2. [We learn more from success than failure](http://www.businessinsider.com/we-learn-more-from-success-than-failure-2014-6?IR=T). A bit semantic, and where is this government agency with a learn-from-failure culture? But worth the read.

	
  3. [The 2014 Nanny State awards](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/say-no-to-the-nanny-state-paid-for-by-you-for-your-own-good-20141221-12bmc5.html).

	
  4. [Robert Sapolsky on the Christmas truce of 1914](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spirit-of-the-1914-christmas-truce-1419006906).

	
  5. [People like gifts that they want](http://timharford.com/2014/12/you-really-really-shouldnt-have%E2%80%89-%E2%80%89-%E2%80%89-%E2%80%89/).

	
  6. [Greater contact between racial groups increases bias](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/19/the-troubling-reason-why-whites-in-some-states-may-show-more-hidden-racial-bias/)? (HT: [Razib Khan](https://twitter.com/razibkhan))

	
  7. [Another arena where a bit more science might help - the justice system](http://aeon.co/magazine/society/how-can-we-rid-the-legal-system-of-bad-science/).

	
  8. [The Accidental Lobster Farmers](http://modernfarmer.com/2014/12/maines-accidental-lobster-farmers/) (HT: Tyler Cowen).

	
  9. Nothing like an article confirming my priors - [LaTeX is a productivity sink](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0115069) (HT: [Alex Tabarrok](https://twitter.com/ATabarrok)). A common comment I receive from economists on my papers is "Did you do this in Word?" The funny thing with LaTeX is that most people don't change the default font - if you did that, people might not know it was prepared with LaTeX.
