After my recent [post on how I focus](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/how-i-focus-and-live/), I received a couple of requests for the blogs I follow. Here are my current subscriptions in Feedly, with occasional comments.

Some of these blogs have been in my reader for years, others I am trialling. I am usually trialling a few at any time, and tend to have a "one in, one out" pattern of subscription. It normally takes me about 10 minutes once every day or two to scan the new entries and decide which are worth reading. This set of blogs generates more posts for my read later pile than I can get through.
