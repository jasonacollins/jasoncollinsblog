title: Videos for the Biological Basis of Preferences and Behavior Conference
---

[Videos of the presentations](http://bfi.uchicago.edu/events/20120504_biologicalbasis/) at the Biological Basis of Preferences and Behaviour conference have been put online. Many are worth watching. I hope to write more detailed posts about a few of the presentations soon, but the three presentations I got the most out of were:

1. “Social Networks and Cooperation in Hunter-Gatherers” by Coren Apicella. Presentations such as this always remind me that I should be reading far more work by anthropologists.
2. “The Genetic Architecture of Economic and Political Preferences” by David Cesarini. A good introduction to the growing field of genoeconomics.
3. “Cognitive Trade-Offs in Chimpanzee Versus Human Mixed Strategy Play” by Colin Camerer. Don't play poker against chimpanzees. I've [posted on these chimps before](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/chimps-1-humans-0/).

My earlier posts on the conference include [my general impressions](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-biological-basis-of-preferences-and-behaviour-conference/) and [some comments](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/game-theory-and-the-peacocks-tail/) on the presentation by Balazs Szentes.
