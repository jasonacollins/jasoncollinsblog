Links this week:

1. [On the misplaced politics of behavioral policy interventions](http://home.uchicago.edu/~/davetannenbaum/documents/partisan%20nudge%20bias.pdf). And [hawkish biases](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/04/kahneman_and_re.html).

2. Noah Smith v Bryan Caplan on education signalling - [1](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-27/economists-need-to-give-up-on-overused-signaling-fad), [2](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/04/educational_sig_1.html) and [3](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com.au/2015/04/a-follow-up-on-college-and-signaling.html). I believe signalling is an important part of the education story, but Smith's argument about _costly_ signalling is on point.

And if you missed it, my one post this last week:

  1. [Bad nudges toward organ donation](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/bad-nudges-organ-donation-edition/).

Life continues to be busy, so posting will continue to be sparse.
