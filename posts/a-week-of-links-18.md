Links this week:



	
  1. [Robert Kurzban reports](http://www.epjournal.net/blog/2013/05/are-all-dictator-game-results-artifacts/) on a very cool dictator game experiment. Do people only give money in experimental conditions?

	
  2. [Nicholas Gruen digs up](http://clubtroppo.com.au/2013/05/20/the-politics-of-envy-or-something-more-worthy/) a nice Alfred Marshall quote.

	
  3. [Peter Turchin calls on](http://socialevolutionforum.com/2013/05/20/why-become-a-farmer/) cultural group selection to explain the transition to farming. Or maybe it's because "[people like to own stuff](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/05/13/183710778/why-humans-took-up-farming-they-like-to-own-stuff)".

	
  4. [A take-down of the paper](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/22/the-wisdom-of-the-ancients/) suggesting the Victorians were smarter than us.

	
  5. [The French fertility transition](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/05/french-fertility-fall.html).
