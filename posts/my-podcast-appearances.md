Over the last few years I have appeared on several podcasts, the most recent being a discussion with [Phil Agnew](https://twitter.com/p_agnew) on the Nudge podcast. I am definitely more a writer than a speaker, but if you prefer audio to the written, check out the below.

[Nudge podcast - Beware of Behaviour Science BS](https://www.nudgepodcast.com/podcast/episode/31c2d373/75-beware-of-behaviour-science-bs)

[42courses - Behavioural Science & Evolutionary Biology](https://anchor.fm/42courses/episodes/Jason-Collins---Behavioural-Science--Evolutionary-Biology-epfoqs)

[Todd Nief - Loss Aversion and Ergodicity Economics](https://toddnief.com/jason-collins-interview/): This was a long and pretty technical conversation on the back of a [primer I wrote on ergodicity economics](/ergodicity-economics-a-primer/). Todd's audience spans crossfit, death metal and the rationalist community. He assured me that my collection of early Sepultura records from my youth classifies as proto-death metal, so I managed to have some connection to all three.

[A Bunch of BS - Knowing Our Limits, Expanding Our Knowledge](https://www.behaviorist.biz/bspodcast/jason-collins)

[Rationally Speaking with Julia Galef - A skeptical take on behavioral economics](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/219-a-skeptical-take-on-behavioral-economics-jason-collins/): I wrote a [post afterward offering some additional thoughts](/me-on-rationally-speaking-plus-some-additional-thoughts/). (Rationally Speaking is one of the few podcasts for which I listen to at least the beginning of every episode.)
