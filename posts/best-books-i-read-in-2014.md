Continuing my tradition of giving the best books I read in the year - generally released in other years - the best books I read in 2014 are below (albeit from a smaller pool than usual).

- John Coates’s (2012)  [The Hour Between Dog and Wolf: Risk Taking, Gut Feelings and the Biology of Boom and Bust](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-biology-of-boom-and-bust/): The best book I read this year. An innovative consideration of how human biology affects financial decision making.

- Gregory Clark's (2013) [The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-genetic-basis-of-social-mobility/): Not the most exciting book to read, but an important examination of social mobility.

- David Colander and Roland Kupers's (2014) [Complexity and the Art of Public Policy](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/complexity-and-the-art-of-public-policy/): An important way to think about policy, even though I'm not convinced by many of their proposed applications.

- Gerd Gigerenzer's (2010) *Rationality for Mortals: How People Cope with Uncertainty*: Essays capturing a lot of Gigerenzer's important work. I reread it following his disappointing [Risk Savvy](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/nudging-citizens-to-be-risk-savvy/). I didn't write a review, but posted about parts of the book [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/four-perspectives-on-human-decision-making/), [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-power-of-heuristics/) and [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-unrealistic-assumptions-of-biology/).

- Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir’s (2013) [Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/scarcity-of-time-money-friends-and-bandwidth/): A novel way of looking at scarcity that extends beyond the typical analysis in economics, but I’m not convinced it presents a coherent new perspective on how the world works.

- P.G. Wodehouse’s (1936) Young Men in Spats: Magic.
