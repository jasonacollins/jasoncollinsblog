The best books I _read_ in 2016 - generally released in other years - are below (in no particular order). For the non-fiction books, the links lead to my reviews.

- Joe Henrich's [The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/henrichs-the-secret-of-our-success-how-culture-is-driving-human-evolution-domesticating-our-species-and-making-us-smarter/) (2015): A lot of interesting ideas, but left me with a lot of questions.

- Garett Jones's [Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/joness-hive-mind-how-your-nations-iq-matters-so-much-more-than-your-own/) (2015): A fantastic exposition of some important but neglected features of the world.

- Phil Rosenzweig’s [Left Brain, Right Stuff: How Leaders Make Winning Decisions](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/rosenzweigs-left-brain-right-stuff-how-leaders-make-winning-decisions/) (2014): An entertaining examination of how behavioural economics findings hold up for real world decision making.

- Philip Tetlock’s [Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/tetlocks-expert-political-judgment-how-good-is-it-how-can-we-know/) (2006): I re-read this before reading Tetlock's also good [Superforecasting](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/tetlock-and-gardners-superforecasting-the-art-and-science-of-prediction/), but Expert Political Judgement is the superior of the two books.

- Jonathan Last’s [What to Expect When No One’s Expecting: America’s Coming Demographic Disaster](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/lasts-what-to-expect-when-no-ones-expecting-americas-coming-demographic-disaster/) (2014): Much to disagree or argue with, but entertaining and a lot to like.

- John Kay’s [Other People’s Money](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/kays-other-peoples-money/) (2015): A fantastic critique of the modern financial system and regulation.

- Fyodor Dostoevsky’s [Crime and Punishment](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2554): The classic I most enjoyed.
