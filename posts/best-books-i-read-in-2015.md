title: Best books I read in 2015
---

A touch late, but as for earlier years, my list comprises the best books I read in the year, not the best of those released in the year (in fact, almost every book I read was released before 2015). It's a short list - I read only 20 or so non-fiction book this year - but here it is:

*Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier* by Edward Glaeser. A strong message for environmentalists.

[Spent](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/millers-spent-sex-evolution-and-consumer-behavior/) by Geoffrey Miller. I included this book in my [2011 list](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/best-books-i-read-in-2011/), but read it again this year in preparation for a presentation I was giving. It deserves to be listed again. Evolutionary psychology at its most readable.

[Uncontrolled:The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/manzis-uncontrolled/) by James Manzi. It should be read by every social scientist.

I read a bunch of long classics, including Tolstoy's War and Peace and Anna Karenina, and Conrad's Nostromo (fantastic). One strong recommendation is Richard Flanagan’s *The Narrow Road to the Deep North*.

As an aside, I also re-read Daniel Kahneman's[ Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/). I included it in my [2012 list](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-best-books-i-read-in-2012/), and my rating of it has dropped. The last four years haven't been kind to some sections. (I posted about this [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/re-reading-kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/)).

I’ve got a dozen or so sets of notes from books I read last year that I hope to turn into posts in the near future - including for *The Triumph of the City*, Kenrick and Griskevicius's [The Rational Animal](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/kenrick-and-griskeviciuss-the-rational-animal/), Saad's *The Consuming Instinct*, Thiel's [Zero to One](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/thiels-zero-to-one/), Levitin's *The Organized Mind* and Taleb's *Antifragile*.

And although I've got copies, I haven't yet read Garett Jones's [Hive Mind](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/joness-hive-mind-how-your-nations-iq-matters-so-much-more-than-your-own/), Joe Henrich's [The Secret of Our Success](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/henrichs-the-secret-of-our-success-how-culture-is-driving-human-evolution-domesticating-our-species-and-making-us-smarter/) or Greg Ip's [Foolproof](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/ips-foolproof-why-safety-can-be-dangerous-and-how-danger-makes-us-safe/) (although I have been giving out the first two of these as Christmas presents).

Past lists: [2010](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/top-10-books-in-2010/), [2011](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/best-books-i-read-in-2011/), [2012](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-best-books-i-read-in-2012/), [2013](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/best-books-i-read-in-2013/) and [2014](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/best-books-i-read-in-2014/).
