I'm excited that I can finally announce the Cooperation and Conflict in the Family Conference.


<blockquote>**First announcement**

The Cooperation and Conflict in the Family conference will be held at UNSW in Sydney, Australia from February 2-5 2014.

We will bring together leading economic and evolutionary researchers to explore the nature of conflict and cooperation between the sexes in the areas of marriage, mating and fertility.

The conference provides an opportunity for researchers to discuss the economic and evolutionary biology approaches to these issues, explore common ground and identify collaborative opportunities.
