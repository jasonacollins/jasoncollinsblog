Four links this week:

  1. Quamrul Ashraf and Oded Galor's [paper on genetic diversity and economic growth](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.103.1.1) has been formally published in February 2013 edition of the American Economic Review (ungated working paper version [here](http://ideas.repec.org/p/iza/izadps/dp6330.html)). When its release was foreshadowed a few months ago, it generated some interesting debate (such as [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/harvard-academics-on-genetic-diversity-and-economic-development/) and [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/genetic-diversity-and-economic-development-ashraf-and-galor-respond/), particularly in the [comments](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/harvard-academics-on-genetic-diversity-and-economic-development/#comments)). Starting next week I'm going to write series of posts examining the threads of Ashraf and Galor's argument.
	
  2. [The gorilla is invisible](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wray-herbert/the-really-scary-invisibl_b_2574791.html), even to radiologists.
	
  3. Was [Herbert Spencer a Social Darwinist](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2011/11/a-bleeding-heart-history-of-libertarian-thought-herbert-spencer/)? (From late 2011, but a good read)
	
  4. [Stephen Corry of Survival International lays into Diamond and Pinker](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/30/savaging-primitives-why-jared-diamond-s-the-world-until-yesterday-is-completely-wrong.html). (HT: [Evolvify](https://twitter.com/evolvify))
