The best books I _read_ in 2018 - generally released in other years - are below. Where I have reviewed, the link leads to that review.

* Nick Bostrom, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies (2014) - Changed my mind, and gave me a framework for thinking about the problem that I didn't have before.

* Annie Duke, Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts (2018) - While I have many small quibbles with the content, and it could easily have been a long-form article, I  liked the overarching approach and framing.

* Gary Klein, Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions (1998) - Rightfully considered classic in decision-making. Review coming soon

* Michael Lewis's [The Undoing Project](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/michael-lewiss-the-undoing-project-a-friendship-that-changed-the-world/) (2016) - Despite focusing on Kahneman and Tversky's relationship, it is also one of the better introductions to their work.

* Robert Sapolsky's Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst (2017) - A wonderful examination of what "causes" of our actions. Sapolsky zooms out from the almost immediate activity in our brain, to the actions of our hormones over seconds to hours, through our developmental influences, out to our evolutionary past. Review also coming soon.

* Robert Sapolsky's [Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/robert-sapolskys-why-zebras-dont-get-ulcers/) (3rd ed, 2004) - Great writing and interesting science.

* Fred Schwed, Where Are the Customer's Yachts? (1955) - Timeless commentary on the value delivered by the financial services sector

* Robert Sugden, [The Community of Advantage: A Behavioural Economist's Defence of the Market](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/robert-sugdens-the-community-of-advantage-a-behavioural-economists-defence-of-the-market/) (2018) - The most compelling critique of the practical application of behavioural economics that I have read.

* Joseph Conrad, Lord Jim - I love Conrad. Nostromo is possibly my favourite book.

* Daphne Du Maurier, Rebecca

* Henry James, Turn of the Screw

Below is the full list of books that I read in 2018 (with links where reviewed and starred if a reread). Relative to previous years, I read (and reread) fewer books in total, less non-fiction, more fiction. That was largely a consequence of regularly reading my youngest to sleep.

My non-fiction reading through 2018 was less deliberate than I would have liked. There are fewer timeless pieces in the list than usual, with many of the choices based on whim or the particular piece of work I was doing at the time.
