title: Darwin on female preferences
---

I am slowly re-reading Darwin's [The Descent of Man](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2300) and came across the following gem:


<blockquote>The female, on the other hand, with the rarest exceptions, is less eager than the male. As the illustrious Hunter ... long ago observed, she generally "requires to be courted;" she is coy, and may often be seen endeavouring for a long time to escape from the male. ... Or she may accept, as appearances would sometimes lead us to believe, not the male which is the most attractive to her, but the one which is the least distasteful. The exertion ofÂ some choice on the part of the female seems a law almost as general as the eagerness of the male.</blockquote>
