As for last year, this year's top book list comprises the best books I _have read_ this year. I haven't read enough books published in 2011 to be able to apply a decent filter, plus there are many books out there that we should not forget. In no particular order:

[Flatland: a romance of many dimensions](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97) by Edwin Abbott - Clever, fun satire

[Sex, Genes & Rock 'N' Roll: How Evolution has Shaped the Modern World](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/brookss-sex-genes-rock-n-roll/) by Rob Brooks - While the book is generally a fun read, it makes this list for two specific parts: the discussions of sexual conflict in the context of population and on obesity ([my](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/brookss-sex-genes-rock-n-roll/) [discussion of the obesity chapter](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/evolution-and-obesity/)).

*Frankenstein* by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley - One of the classics that lives up to its reputation.

[Spent: Sex, Evolution and Behavior](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/millers-spent-sex-evolution-and-consumer-behavior/) by Geoffrey Miller - Miller's analysis of consumer culture under the lens of evolution is the sharpest I have read - and the most fun.

[The Darwin Economy: Liberty, Competition, and the Common Good](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/franks-the-darwin-economy/) by Robert Frank - While the main point in this book could have been presented as an essay and I disagree with many of the applications, the central concept that competition is not always for the common good, as we can see in evolution, is important.

[The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/fukuyamas-the-origins-of-political-order/) by Francis Fukuyama - Fukuyama's use of kin selection as the foundation to his analysis gives this book a solid foundation lacking from most grand histories ([some earlier comments](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/fukuyamas-biological-approach/)).

[Theory of the Leisure Class](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/veblens-the-theory-of-the-leisure-class/) by Thorstein Veblen - This book was hard to read and at times inconsistent, but it is clear why it is one of those important books for economists to read.

[The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/zimbardos-the-lucifer-effect/) by Philip Zimbardo - Although these books are in no particular order, I am going to suggest that this is probably the best. It had me thinking like few others (my [review](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/zimbardos-the-lucifer-effect/) and [a later musing](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/iq-externalities/)).

There are a few books not on this list that were released this year and I have have high hopes for - Pinker's *The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined*, Kahneman's [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/) and Triver's [The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/triverss-the-folly-of-fools/).
