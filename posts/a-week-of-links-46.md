  3. Some chaff in with the wheat, but this [article on Social Darwinism](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/01/social_darwinism_and_class_essentialism_the_rich_think_they_are_superior.html) reports some interesting research.

  5. [A new paper in JEBO](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2013.12.007). People cooperate because they are selfish. ([ungated pdf](http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~drand/dreber_rand_fudenberg_2014.pdf))

And to close, my twitter and blog feeds contain an inordinate amount of baseball content. I don't understand why economists are so interested in baseball, despite the fact they can use their statistical skills to re-live the jock versus nerd battles of their childhood (In the same way, I don't understand my countrymen's infatuation with cricket - adults chasing balls?). Surely there are more interesting statistics.

So, to get some real sport into your feeds (this being the only sport in which I can bring myself to watch), I'm introducing a semi-regular surf link or clip to my week of links posts. Today, some awesome Pipeline footage (using drones, another area that economists seem to be infatuated with). I love how you can see the reef, the holes in it, and how the water depth changes so suddenly at its edge. Other highlights - Kelly Slater at 1:05 catching the wave that won him the recent Pipe Masters, and the crowd all paddling for the horizon at 2:54 when they see some sets starting to rear up on third reef. (As an aside, surfing could use some numerate economists - from the [almost award of the Eddie Aikau to Tony Ray](http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Jan/08/sp/sp02a.html) to the [premature crowning of Kelly Slater as world champion](http://www.aspworldtour.com/2011/11/04/asp-admits-calculation-error-prematurely-crowned-2011-asp-world-champion/), the surfing hierarchy could benefit from the ability to add.)
