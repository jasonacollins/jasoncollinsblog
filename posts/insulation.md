In the early days of the Behavioural Insights Team (aka The Nudge Unit), their successes quickly became part of the behavioural economics canon. They were pretty much the only behavioural team publishing their results publicly 

It was handy. When I was leading the PwC Australia team, we typically couldn't use our internal stories in training or public presentations. They Behavioural Insights Team results became the way we publicly communicated.
