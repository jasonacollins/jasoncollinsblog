In the early days of the Behavioural Insights Team (aka The Nudge Unit), their successes quickly became part of the behavioural economics canon. They were pretty much the only behavioural team publishing their results publicly

These stories included adding social norms to tax letters increased on-time submission, 

It was handy. When I was leading the PwC Australia team, we typically couldn't use our internal stories in training or public presentations. They Behavioural Insights Team results became the way we publicly communicated.

One story that I heard a lot concerned installation of loft insulation as an energy efficiency measure. Could removing the hassle factor, by offering a loft cleanout together with the installation, increase takeup.

Here's how David Halpern describes the results in Inside the Nudge Unit.

> A no-brainer to help save the planet, or at least reduce emissions and save citizens money, concerns energy conservation. The stand-out example of this in colder countries is to encourage people to insulate their lofts, or attics. ... [P]ayback period for loft insulation is typically one to two years, and for cavity insulation one to four, depending on building type. In other words, the consumer is getting between 25 and 100 per cent interest on their investment per year, an outstanding deal by any account.
> 
> On top of this, many governments have spent billions subsidising and promoting insulation. Given this, it was puzzling that there were still people who had not installed such insulation ... After looking at the issue, and talking to industry and householders, we concluded that the problem was less about money and more about hassle. Specifically, people couldn’t bear the thought of having to clear out the contents of their lofts.
> 
> To see if this was the case ... we ran a leaflet trial with a commercial provider offering households in different areas of London one of three offers:
> 
> - A home insulation service at a low, but standard cost.
> - A home insulation service with a substantial extra discount if any of your neighbours also booked the same service (the idea being that it was cheaper for the installer to do a couple of houses in one go, and you were more likely to insulate your home if a neighbour encouraged you).
> - A home insulation service combined with a loft clearance service, albeit at a significant extra cost to insulation alone.

> This was not a perfect trial in methodological terms. The different leaflets were tried in similar but separate local areas, and not therefore perfectly randomised and total numbers were small. Nonetheless, the effects were still striking. Compared with the basic offer, the extra discount made almost no difference. People certainly liked the idea, but the increase in uptake was very small and not statistically significant. In contrast, the loft clearance offer, despite costing several hundred pounds extra, had a three-times higher level of take-up.
> 
> It wasn’t that cost did not matter. In a later variation, which involved offering the loft clearance scheme at cost in order to lower the price, uptake was even higher (at around five times the standard offer). But the trial powerfully illustrated that, at least for the minority of households that had yet to insulate their lofts, it wasn’t the price of the insulation that was the barrier, but the fact that they couldn’t face the hassle of clearing their lofts.



I won't discuss the discount for neighbours (you can find the report about that here) but will focus on the power illustration that price is not the barrier, but rather the hassle of cleaning their lofts.
