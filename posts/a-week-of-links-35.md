Links this week:



	
  1. [Enrico Spolaore and Romain Wacziarg write on genetic barriers to growth](http://www.voxeu.org/article/long-term-barriers-growth). I have previously posted on their work [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-deep-roots-of-economic-development/), [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-intergenerational-transmission-of-economic-development/) and [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/genetic-distance-and-economic-development/).

	
  2. [Doug Kenrick on Free Market Psychology](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201309/cruzonomics-the-problem-free-market-psychology). There needs to be a rule that only those who have read Adam Smith are allowed to describe Adam Smith's take on the invisible hand

	
  3. Also at Psychology Today, [Matthew Rossano on human and Neanderthal rituals](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mortal-rituals/201309/two-caves-two-rituals-two-species). The difference - cost. (HT: [OneNakedApe](https://twitter.com/OneNakedApe))

	
  4. [Malcolm Gladwell is interviewed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/10335491/Malcolm-Gladwell-interview.html) in The Telegraph. [Christopher Chabris reviews](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304713704579093090254007968.html) Gladwell's latest book.

	
  5. More Gladwell - on [genes and fairness in sport](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2013/09/09/130909crat_atlarge_gladwell?currentPage=all). Despite Gladwell's flaws (see my [thoughts on Outliers](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/gladwells-outliers/)), I need to find some time to write a contrarian "In praise of Malcolm Gladwell" piece during this Gladwell bashing season (which it must be based on my twitter feed).

	
  6. Finally, the [Human Fertility Collection](http://www.fertilitydata.org/cgi-bin/index.php) has been launched. It is a supplement to the [Human Fertility Database](http://www.humanfertility.org/cgi-bin/main.php), and contains additional data that doesn't meet HFD standards.
