Links this week:

	
  1. Hodgson and Knudsen have [set up a reading group](http://darwinsconjecture.wordpress.com/about/) for their book [Darwin's Conjecture: The Search for General Principles of Social and Economic Evolution](/darwins-conjecture-generalising-darwinism/). Chapter one has already kicked off.

	
  2. Another from The Umlaut - [Conspicuous Frugality](http://theumlaut.com/2013/04/24/conspicuous-frugality/).

	
  3. [Flip-flopping selection pressure](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/35317/title/Humans-Under-Pressure/) in a modern population.

	
  4. Following from my post on Douglas Kenrick and colleagues' theory of [Deep Rationality](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/deep-rationality-the-evolutionary-economics-of-decision-making/), below are a couple of short videos - one on How Mating and Self-Protection Motives Alter Loss Aversion, and the other on the upcoming book [The Rational Animal: How Evolution Made Us Smarter Than We Think](/kenrick-and-griskeviciuss-the-rational-animal/) by Kenrick and Vlad Griskevicius, which also looks like it covers similar territory.
