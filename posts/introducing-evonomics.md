What is [Evonomics](http://evonomics.com/)?


<blockquote>_Evonomics_ is an online magazine and intellectual movement built on the pillars of complexity science and evolutionary principles, and includes key insights from the synthesis that has slowly been growing across disciplines in areas like behavioral, experimental, institutional, and ecological economics. The magazine showcases the new scientific foundations for human nature and society and demonstrates its relevance to contemporary economic and political issues.</blockquote>
