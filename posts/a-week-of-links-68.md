Links this week:
	
1. [The Genetic Genealogist responds](http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2014/09/13/response-genetic-testing-article-vox/) to Vox's tabloid piece on genetic testing.

2. Attempts to correct false claims often entrench them - the backfire effect. [But telling politicians they will be fact checked still reduced their number of lies](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/inquiring-minds-brendan-nyhan-fact-checking-2014-election). [Update: There is probably no backfire effect.]

4. [Violence in chimps an evolutionary adaptation](http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/science/2014/09/17/war-innate-chimpanzees-lethal-attacks-may-provide-advantage-eliminating-rivals/V3lwx38s1RId3ZACQmnuiJ/story.html?rss_id=Top-GNP).

5. [Another study showing low social mobility](http://ereh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/15/ereh.heu015.short?rss=1).

6. [A great collection of papers](http://www.psy.miami.edu/ehblab/controversies.html) on altruism, reciprocity and the glucose model of self control.
