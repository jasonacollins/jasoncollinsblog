Links this week:



	
  1. [Peter Turchin on Ibn Khaldun](http://socialevolutionforum.com/2013/08/26/ibn-khaldun-on-the-rise-and-decline-of-corporate-empires/)Â and the rise and decline of corporate empires.

	
  2. [Another critique of p-values](http://nautil.us/issue/4/the-unlikely/sciences-significant-stats-problem).

	
  3. [John McNamara proposes](http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/88/20130544.full) that we need to move to a richer evolutionary game theory. The article focuses on biology, but many of the same comments could be made of economics. I'll post on the article in coming weeks.

	
  4. [Tyler Cowen on scarcity of mental bandwidth](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/08/scarcity-why-having-too-little-means-so-much.html). And [another take by Emily Badger](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/08/how-poverty-taxes-brain/6716/).

	
  5. The ongoing Evolution: This View of Life series of interviews [On the Origins of Human Behavior And Evolution Society](http://www.thisviewoflife.com/index.php/magazine/articles/on-the-origins-of-human-behavior-and-evolution-society-william-irons) moves to William Irons.
