Links this week:
	
  1. A cool idea - [people who are genealogical ancestors of everyone alive but genetic ancestors of none](http://haldanessieve.org/2014/01/16/the-existence-and-abundance-of-ghost-ancestors-in-biparental-populations/) (HT: [Joe Pickrell](https://twitter.com/joe_pickrell)).
	
  2. Philip Ball on [how the apparently irrational can be rational](http://philipball.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/irrational-behaviour-can-be-rational.html).
	
  3. [John Kay on the economic approach](http://www.johnkay.com/2014/01/15/economists-there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-economic-approach) - there is no such thing.
	
  4. [Genetically modified chickens](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/17/would-you-prefer-to-eat-genetically-modified-eggs-or-see-day-old-chicks-destroyed).
	
  5. The annual Edge question is out, this time "[What Scientific Idea is Ready for Retirement?](http://www.edge.org/responses/what-scientific-idea-is-ready-for-retirement)" Of those answers written about areas I am familiar with or interested in, the question has effectively been "What Scientific Idea Don't You Like?" As a result, we get the latest play in old debates on [race](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25534), [IQ](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25422), the limits to growth ([Ridley](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25374), [Hidalgo](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25410) andÂ  [Obrist](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25442)), [inclusive fitness](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25454), gene-environment interactions ([Pinker](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25337) and [Sapolsky](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25536) among others ), [epigenetics](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25502), [rationality](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25426), [homo economicus](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25297) and culture ([Betzig](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25463), [Richerson](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25404) and [Tooby](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25343)). Some are framed in interesting ways (I like Sapolsky's approach), but there are few surprises. I found more value in the answers that addressed approaches to science (such as Richard [Thaler](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25293), Nicholas [Christakis](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25437) and [Samuel Arbesman](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25452)).
	
  6. And finally, [surfing the US-Mexico border fence](http://sergededina.com/tag/surfing-the-border/) (HT: [Michael Clemens](https://twitter.com/m_clem)).
