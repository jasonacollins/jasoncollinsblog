Links this week:






	
  1. Two pieces on diet. First, an excellent article on how the [poisons in vegetables might be making you stronger](http://nautil.us/issue/15/turbulence/fruits-and-vegetables-are-trying-to-kill-you). Second, [a new study in the fat-carb wars](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/health/low-carb-vs-low-fat-diet.html).

	
  2. [Andrew Gelman on the strength of statistical evidence](http://andrewgelman.com/2014/09/03/disagree-alan-turing-daniel-kahneman-regarding-strength-statistical-evidence/).

	
  3. Two excellent podcasts. [Gregory Clark on social mobility](http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2014/the-truth-about-social-mobility) (and the genetics behind it) and [Paul Sabin on the Simon-Ehrlich bet](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/02/paul_sabin_on_e.html). Some of my thoughts on Julian Simon are [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-simon-ehrlich-bet/) and [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/would-julian-simon-worry/).

	
  4. [Economists are happier](http://nzinitiative.org.nz/Media/Insights/Our+Latest+Insights.html?uid=680). The reasons? More cash and religion.
