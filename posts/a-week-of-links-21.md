Links this week:



	
  1. There have been some strong reactions to the [Edge piece on Napoleon Chagnon](http://www.edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument) (I pointed it out last week, and if you haven't yet, give it a look). Some are entertaining, although most are not particularly enlightening. Jason Anstrosio [goes the epigenetics maneuver](http://www.livinganthropologically.com/2013/06/08/human-nature-anthropology-epigenetics/) and Stephen Corry [pins death rates among ancient hunters on hunting accidents](http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/16880-the-case-of-the-brutal-savage-poirot-or-clouseau-or-why-steven-pinker-like-jared-diamond-is-wrong).

	
  2. [If you're risk averse, don't do science - become an actuary](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/06/what-outreach-in-science-is).

	
  3. [The Faroe Islands Health Ministry plans](http://discovermagazine.com/2013/julyaug/01-faroe-islands-aim-to-sequence-genomes-healthcare#.Ubmmsut4aI5) to genetically sequence everyone on the island who wants it.

	
  4. [Overview of the Flynn effect](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2013.04.010) (unfortunately gated if you don't have journal access).

	
  5. [George Monbiot on rewilding](http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2013/a-new-future-for-nature) (audio download)
