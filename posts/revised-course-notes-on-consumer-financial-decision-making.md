Last year I [posted some notes](/course-notes-on-applied-consumer-financial-decision-making/) for a course on Consumer Financial Decision Making.

I have now refreshed those notes, but probably more usefully, also put them into book form using [Quarto](https://quarto.org). Relative to this blog, which is built using markdown and Hugo, Quarto allows the incorporation of computation. It also allows for richer formatting and cross-referencing (without becoming the pain that is LaTeX), and easy production of an associated pdf. I am in the process of converting some of the my other lecture materials into Quarto books.

You can access the new online book on Consumer Financial Decision Making [here](https://cfdm.jasoncollins.blog).
