title: An economics and evolutionary biology reading list
wordpress_id: 2806

I have added a new page with a suggested reading list for those interested in the intersection of economics and evolutionary biology. It is [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/economics-and-evolutionary-biology-reading-list/), and you can see it in the menu bar across the top of the page.

The list is a work is progress, and I plan to update it as new sources emerge or are suggested (or when I realise what oversights I have made). I also intend to constrain it to the best sources, rather than being a complete list on every thought on the topic.

So if you have any suggestions, please let me know. Comments can be made at the bottom of the [reading list page](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/economics-and-evolutionary-biology-reading-list/).
