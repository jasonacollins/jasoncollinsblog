Links this week:



	
  1. [David Barash reviews](http://chronicle.com/article/Sexthe-Single-Organism/142243/) some books taking an evolutionary perspective on reproduction. (HT: [Andrea Castillo](https://twitter.com/anjiecast))

	
  2. A cut from the [Econtalk interview with Tyler Cowen](http://economicspsychologypolicy.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/econtalk-tyler-cowen-discusses-his-new.html). Conscientiousness will become more important in response to increasing opportunities for self-improvement.

	
  3. [Behavioural economists did not discover irrationality](http://www.peterubel.com/2013/10/16/what-drives-me-crazy-about-the-popularity-of-behavioral-economics/). And while we're at it, let's start calling it behavioural science.

	
  4. [How much species diversity was there at the time of _Home erectus_](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/17/skull-homo-erectus-human-evolution)? I love it that such a simple yet obvious consideration can completely change the way of looking at something. (HT: [Daniel Lende](https://twitter.com/daniel_lende))
