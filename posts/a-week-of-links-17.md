  1. [Were the Victorian's cleverer than us](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000470?np=y)? Patrick Rabbit [pulls it apart](http://deevybee.blogspot.com.au/2013/05/have-we-become-slower-and-dumber.html).

	
  2. Kevin Mitchell [has a shot at the new eugenics](http://www.wiringthebrain.com/2013/05/the-new-eugenics-same-as-old-eugenics.html). [Razib responds](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/05/gattaca-utopia-or-dystopia/#.UZXpOIJ4aI4). Read the comments on both.

	
  3. Peter Singer [critiques conspicuous consumption](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-moral-shortcomings-of-conspicuous-consumption-by-peter-singer#vuttmAReTqBqhT2V.99). The example is similar to one Robert Frank uses in [Luxury Fever](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/franks-luxury-fever/), but I still like it.

	
  4. [Gender identity and relative income within households](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/emir.kamenica/documents/identity.pdf) (pdf). I haven't read it yet, but some interesting results.

	
  5. Maybe I'd have more time to read if I cut out the distractions. [Avoid news](http://dobelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Avoid_News_Part1_TEXT.pdf) (HT[ Ryan Murphy](http://increasingmu.wordpress.com/)). Actually, I've almost completely cut news from my diet, but blogs and the twitterverse are still very distracting.

	
  6. [Do markets erode moral values](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130510124501.htm)? I'll post about [the paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6133/707) when I've digested it some more, but I don't think it's the "market" eroding the morals.
