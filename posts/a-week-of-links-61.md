  1. [Some gold from Robert Sapolsky](http://nautil.us/issue/15/turbulence/dude-wheres-my-frontal-cortex) - what is going on in teenage brains? Plus [a bonus interview](http://nautil.us/issue/15/turbulence/ingenious-robert-sapolsky).

	
  2. The [latest issue of Nautilus](http://nautil.us/issue/15/turbulence) (the source of the Sapolsky material) contains a lot of other good material - [fruit and vegetables trying to kill you](http://nautil.us/issue/15/turbulence/fruits-and-vegetables-are-trying-to-kill-you) and [chaos in the brain](http://nautil.us/issue/15/turbulence/your-brain-is-on-the-brink-of-chaos) among them.
