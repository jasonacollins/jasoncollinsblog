The Cooperation and Conflict in the Family conference of early last year has resulted in a follow-up event - the [Economics and Biology of Contests Conference 2016](http://www.contests-conference-2016.qut.edu.au/):

>In February 2016, Brisbane will play host to an exciting gathering of economic and evolutionary thinkers who will explore the potential for a closer synthesis between evolution and economics in order to understand both the economics and biology of behaviour in contest.
>
>The conference aims to bring together leading economists, psychologists and evolutionary biologists to explore contest behaviour in economic, political and social environments. The conference will provide an opportunity for researchers to discuss the economic, psychological and evolutionary biology approaches to this topic, explore common ground and identify collaborative opportunities.

The [keynote speakers](http://www.contests-conference-2016.qut.edu.au/keynote-speakers/) are Roy Baumeister and Roman Sheremeta.

The [call for papers](http://www.contests-conference-2016.qut.edu.au/papers/) is now openÂ and closes on November 15, 2015.
