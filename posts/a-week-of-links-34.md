Links this week:



	
  1. [Paul Frijters on race and IQ](http://economics.com.au/?p=9821) (also read the comments). And if you want some perspective on the epigenetic undertone to that post, [Kevin Mitchell's piece from the beginning of the year](http://www.wiringthebrain.com/2013/01/the-trouble-with-epigenetics-part-2.html) is worth a read.

	
  2. An article that got plenty of press - [how heritable is IQ for people of low SES](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/08/30/0956797613488394.abstract)? [The Wall Street Journal comments](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324492604579083060346652476.html?mod=wsj_nview_latest). There is an excellent discussion of the paper in the comments (including from one of the paper's authors) [over at Information Processing](http://infoproc.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/childhood-ses-amplifies-genetic-effects.html).

	
  3. [Peter Turchin and friends have a new paper out in PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/20/1308825110.abstract) on the transition from small-scale societies to today's massive, complex and largely anonymous societies. [Turchin blogs on the paper](http://socialevolutionforum.com/2013/09/23/can-math-explain-history/) (and [provides a Q&A](http://socialevolutionforum.com/2013/09/25/math-explains-history-ii-qa/)).

	
  4. If you are overwhelmed by the book offerings during peak-PaleoTM, Daniel Lieberman's forthcoming book, *The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease* is probably a good one to put towards the top of your reading pile. [The Guardian asks him a couple of questions](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/22/dieting-disaster-evolution-daniel-lieberman).
