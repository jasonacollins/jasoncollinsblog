title: The best books I read in 2012
---

As is normally the case, my annual list comprises the best books _I have read_ in the past year, irrespective of their date of release. I read fewer books this year than usual, so I'm drawing from a smaller pool than for the last couple of years ([2010](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/top-10-books-in-2010/) and [2011](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/best-books-i-read-in-2011/)). Here are my favourite six for 2012 - links are to reviews:

[Passions Within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/franks-passions-within-reason/) by Robert Frank: A book I should have read a long time ago. I particularly appreciated Frank's use of path-dependent evolution to develop his model of human behaviour.

[The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/haidts-the-righteous-mind/) by Jonathan Haidt: At the top of many lists for good reason.

[Adapt: Why Success Always Starts with Failure](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/harfords-adapt-why-success-always-starts-with-failure/) by Tim Harford: Apart from being interesting and full of reasonable advice, Harford demonstrates a deep understanding of evolutionary processes, which is not often the case in books of this nature.

[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/) by Daniel Kahneman: Magnificent. The clear and accessible way that each chapter illustrates a bias or heuristic makes it the best book on rationality and decision-making that I have read.

*Moby Dick* by Herman Melville: The best classic I read this year. Although I could have skipped some of the detours, many are fascinating.

[Darwinian Politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/rubins-darwinian-politics/) by Paul Rubin: A strong argument for political institutions that maximise freedom.

There are a few books that I read this year that have me in two minds, so I haven't included them in the above list. I enjoyed Ridley's [The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/ridleys-the-rational-optimist/), but despite his claims to the contrary, Ridley stretched the evolutionary metaphor too far in drawing a Panglossian case. Robert Trivers's [The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/triverss-the-folly-of-fools/) would have required a much more thorough editing to make this list. I also enjoyed Kevin Kelly's [What Technology Wants](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/kellys-what-technology-wants/), despite not buying the central argument.

Of the books I have in my reading pile, I still haven't got to Pinker's *The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined*, and I intend to read Flynn's [Are We Getting Smarter?: Rising IQ in the Twenty-First Century](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/flynns-are-we-getting-smarter/) over the Christmas break. Hopefully they will crack next year's list.
