I have updated my [economics and evolutionary biology reading list](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/economics-and-evolutionary-biology-reading-list/), with a few new additions including John Coates's [The Hour Between Dog and Wolf](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-biology-of-boom-and-bust/), Gregory Clark's [new book on social mobility](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/the-genetic-basis-of-social-mobility/) and Jonathan Haidt's [The Righteous Mind](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/haidts-the-righteous-mind/). As before, I have been selective, adding only the best books (or articles) in the area. That said, I am always open for suggestions or comment.

When updating the list, I realised I have written a lot of book reviews over the last few years. I have collected most of them together on one page, which you can find [here](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/book-reviews/). It includes a lot of good books that aren't on the reading list as they are not on topic. It also contains a few books that are on topic but haven't made the cut.
