Links this week:



	
  1. Kids born earlier in the year do better in sport, but this [doesn't seem to apply for academic outcomes](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/youngest-kid-smartest-kid.html).

	
  2. [Rational crack addicts](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/science/the-rational-choices-of-crack-addicts.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0).

	
  3. [Why life at 40 doesn't seem so great](http://timharford.com/2013/09/what-makes-life-sag-in-the-middle/).


Otherwise, this wasn't the most exciting week for links.
