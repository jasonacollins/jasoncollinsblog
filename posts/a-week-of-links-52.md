Again, closer to a month of links:

	
  1. [A great set of essays](http://aeon.co/magazine/nature-and-cosmos/an-expert-roundtable-on-the-selfish-gene-and-evolution/) triggered by David Dobbs's assault on the selfish gene.

	
  2. [Tim Harford on big data](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/21a6e7d8-b479-11e3-a09a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2xasw4x6P). His [piece on behavioural economics](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/9d7d31a4-aea8-11e3-aaa6-00144feab7de.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#axzz2wg5WC8k4) is also worth reading. Take the hype with a grain of salt.

	
  3. The Greg Clark show continues - an [interview on Social Science bites](http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2014/04/gregory-clark-on-names/) and a [presentation at the RSA](http://www.thersa.org/large-text/events/audio-and-past-events/2014/the-truth-about-social-mobility).

	
  4. [A good long-read on de-extinction](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/magazine/the-mammoth-cometh.html?_r=3).

	
  5. [Free-range kids](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/03/hey-parents-leave-those-kids-alone/358631/).
