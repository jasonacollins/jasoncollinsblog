Links this week:

  1. Plenty of press and interesting articles sparked by Peter Thiel's new book. First, [he has a swipe at business schools](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-07/peter-thiel-criticizes-harvard-business-school-praises-aspergers). [And some great one-liners](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/15448437356). [But is he wrong about the future](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-08/peter-thiel-is-wrong-about-the-future)?

	
  2. Another tech-billionaire - [Elon Musk wants to put people of Mars](http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/the-elon-musk-interview-on-mars/).

	
  3. Eric Crampton has some great posts this week on public health. First, [where should the money be going?](http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/public-health-and-market-failures.html)Â  [Some thoughts on soda taxes](http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/sugar-tax.html) and [fat taxes](http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/bjornskov-on-fat-taxes.html). [And drinking when pregnant](http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/no-safe-level.html).

	
  4. [Cameron Murray risks walking onto Steven Landsburg's lawn](http://ckmurray.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/grandpa-landsburg-rocking-chair.html).

	
  5. [Rajiv Sethi defends agent based models from Chris House](http://rajivsethi.blogspot.de/2014/08/the-agent-based-method.html). House tends to overreach when he strolls into the unfamiliar and attacks the heterodox rather than his standard (and also not overly convincing) defense of the orthodox.

	
  6. [Put your laptops away kids](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368).

	
  7. [The missing heritability puzzle is slowing being chipped away](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3097.html). But the genetic post-modernists [continue their losing battle](http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.ch/2014/10/the-height-of-folly-are-causes-of.html).

	
  8. [The heritability of educational attainment reflects many genetically influenced traits, not just intelligence](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/10/02/1408777111.abstract). A [Science Daily summary](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/10/141006152151.htm). Plus, [emotional intelligence is overrated](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140930125543-69244073-emotional-intelligence-is-overrated) (HT: [Stuart Ritchie](https://twitter.com/StuartJRitchie)). Intelligence is important, and to the extent other traits matter, they are heritable too.

	
  9. [Does evolutionary theory need a rethink?](http://www.nature.com/news/does-evolutionary-theory-need-a-rethink-1.16080) No.

	
  10. [Doctor decision fatigue - more unnecessary antibiotics in the afternoon](http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/8/6939623/antibiotics-afternoon-overprescribe-resistance-doctors-decision-fatigue-ego-depletion-glucose).
