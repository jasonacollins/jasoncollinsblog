This week we have paleo for dogs, irrational consumers and the question of what is the right size:



	
  1. [John Hawks posts](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/dogs/dog-selection-starch-axelsson-2013.html) on a [new Nature paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11837) that provides a reason for "why we feed dogs kibble instead of raw beef" - well, at least those who don't have their dogs on the paleo diet. Like humans with a long agricultural history, dogs have extensive duplication of the amylase gene, which assists in the digestion of starch. [Razib asks](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/01/as-man-is-the-dog-is) "Is Paleolithic man to Holocene man what the wolf is to the dog?"

	
  2. [The Atlantic covers](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/the-irrational-consumer-why-economics-is-dead-wrong-about-how-we-make-choices/267255/) a [new paper by Daniel McFadden](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18687) that summarises the case against the neoclassical economic view of the consumer. From a quick skim, there's not too many surprises but it's a nice summary.

	
  3. [Nick Gruen](http://twitter.com/NGruen1) tweeted a link to this 1928 classic by J.B.S. Haldane, [On Being the Right Size](http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html). Andy Haldane of the Bank of England borrowed it for [a speech on bank size](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2012/speech615.pdf). I suggest going [back to the original](http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html).
