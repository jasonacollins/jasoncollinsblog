Links this week:



	
  1. E.O. Wilson's [argument that great scientists don't need math](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323611604578398943650327184.html) has already received [plenty of responses](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/04/e_o_wilson_is_wrong_about_math_and_science.html). Wilson's argument reminded me of [one of Paul Krugman's critiques](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/krugman-on-gould-and-maynard-smith/) of Stephen Jay Gould's popular work, which were "literary confection" as they lacked math.

	
  2. [A free webinar](http://www.tiptaplab.com/tiptap-lab-webinar) with Geoffrey Miller and others on _What Every Marketer Should Know About the Nonconscious_.

	
  3. [Diane Coyle posts](http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2013/04/humans-not-agents/) on a [paper by Sergio Da Silva](http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/45660/1/MPRA_paper_45660.pdf)Â in which he argues that "economics fails to ground itself in the underlying knowledge provided by biology".

	
  4. While researching a paper, I came across this [20 year-old piece by Jared Diamond](http://discovermagazine.com/1993/mar/tenthousandyears189#.UWiNkCsY3_Q) on the isolation and technological regress of the Tasmanian aboriginals.
