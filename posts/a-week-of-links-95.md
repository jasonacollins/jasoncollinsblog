Links this week:






	
  1. ["If compulsory voting were to help Democrats at all, it would probably help the bad Democrats. The Democrats would end up running and electing more intolerant, innumerate, hawkish candidates."](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2015/03/the-demographic-argument-for-compulsory-voting-with-a-guest-appearance-by-the-real-reason-the-left-advocates-compulsory-voting/)

	
  2. [The management / bureaucratic speak of World Bank reports](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/03/how-has-the-language-of-world-bank-reports-changed.html). It's worth clicking [through to the full article](http://newleftreview.org/II/92/franco-moretti-dominique-pestre-bankspeak).

	
  3. [Paul Meehl was talking about today's problems in psychology 30 years ago](http://andrewgelman.com/2015/03/23/paul-meehl-continues-boss/).

	
  4. [The problems of financially strapped Americans are not caused by private jets and billionaires buying islands.](http://www.cato-unbound.org/2015/03/20/megan-mcardle/real-solutions-are-also-harder-solutions)

	
  5. [Does adoption increase IQ](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/03/18/1417106112.abstract)?

	
  6. [An attempt to pull apart the recent breastfeeding study](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/about-that-breastfeeding-study/388309/), but still no mention of genetics.

	
  7. [Accessing doctor or lawyer track records](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/03/dissing-track-records.html).

	
  8. [Might GMO labelling backfire](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/18/nutrition-labels-gmos-psychology-of-disclosure-column/23991915/)? HT: [Ryan Murphy](https://twitter.com/increasingmu). My guess is that if people avoided foods containing GMOs, their health would improve in the short term by decreasing their consumption of processed foods. In the longer-term, as GM fruit and vegetables start to become prevalent, I am not so sure.

	
  9. [Relatednesss and eusociality](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002098). HT: [Stuart West](https://twitter.com/StuWest8)
