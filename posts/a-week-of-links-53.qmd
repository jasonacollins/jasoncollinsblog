Links this week:



	
  1. It's from late last year, but [this piece on the biological origins of morality](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/why-we-fightand-can-we-stop/309525/) is worth reading.

	
  2. A new journal, Economic Anthropology, with the [debut issue on greed and excess](http://blog.aaanet.org/2014/04/08/debut-issue-of-economic-anthropology-greed-and-excess-2/) (and sorry, gated for those without academic access).

	
  3. Diane Coyle points to some [older work on wealth and inheritance](http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2014/04/thinking-about-capital/). She also pointed me to this [good interview with E.O Wilson](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/04/search-until-you-find-a-passion-and-go-all-out-to-excel-in-its-expression/).

	
  4. [Another good bash of p-values](http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700).

	
  5. [Who is buying the cigarettes](http://www.iea.org.uk/blog/talk-is-cheap-do-smokers-really-want-to-quit)? HT: [Bryan Caplan](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/04/smoking_social.html)

	
  6. [Baby names](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26634477). HT: [Eric Crampton](http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/nominalism.html)
