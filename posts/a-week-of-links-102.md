Links this week:

  1. Two perspectives on the chocolate study - [Scott Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/30/that-chocolate-study/) and [Andrew Gelman](http://andrewgelman.com/2015/05/29/i-fooled-millions-into-thinking-chocolate-helps-weight-loss-heres-how/). I would say that the chocolate study didn't tell us anything that we didn't already know.

	
  2. [Self-deluded leaders](http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2015/06/surviving-self-deluded-leaders.html).

	
  3. [The education myth](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/06/the-education-myth.html).

	
  4. [If only chimpanzees had ovens](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/us/chimpanzees-can-cook-a-mean-potato-research-says.html). HT: [Tyler Cowen](https://twitter.com/tylercowen)
