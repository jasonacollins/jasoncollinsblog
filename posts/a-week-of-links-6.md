  4. I've uploaded an updated version of [my working paper Conspicuous Consumption, Sexual Selection and Economic Growth](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/sexual-selection-conspicuous-consumption-and-economic-growth-2). There are no earth-shattering changes, but we've simplified the second model and generally sharpened it up.
