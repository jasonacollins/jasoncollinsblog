As Gary Marcus often appears in my various feeds, I decided to grab his 2008 book [Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kluge_(book)) from my overgrown reading pile. I'm glad I did, as it gave context to his critique of generative AI. It didn't, however, teach me much about the human mind.

Marcus's argument is that the human mind is a 'kluge', a clumsy or inelegant yet surprisingly effective solution to a problem. Like our backward-installed retina and spine more suited to quadrupedal than upright walking, the human mind is - while impressive - flawed. (Random aside: like me, Marcus is a big user of em-dashes. And like Marcus, I'm going to keep using them.)

The accumulation of kluges comes from the path dependent nature of evolution. There is no grand designer constructing an optimal human (or human mind) from scratch. Rather, humans evolved through a series of incremental tweaks, each built upon the last. If we think of the fitness landscape - fitness being a measure of relative xxx - If we consider evolution as climbing a mountain toward higher fitness, each change that spreads will be more fit in the current environment, but any peak that is found may not be the highest conceivable.

On one level, this is uncontroversial. Few would disagree that evolution is a path dependent process or that we have clunky mental structures that would not be "designed". The exception to that might be creationists, who Marcus targets in the final chapter. No "intelligent designer" would have put us together that way. This does give a slightly dated feel to the book as those creationist-atheist debates of the late 'aughts' have largely withered away.

However, through the body of the book, Marcus's more common foil is adaptationist streams of evolutionary thinking. Much evolutionary psychology literature has a starting point of seeking to understand the purpose of our foibles rather than labelling them as kluges. Why might men overestimate the sexual intentions of potential mates? Asymmetric errors. The genes of the man who misses true opportunities is no longer with us. It isn't a kluge but an optimal adaptation.

I have sympathy for this critique. However, Marcus didn't convince me at all, and the weakness of his arguments left me wondering if I should update in the other direction.

The prime reason for this is while the general critique might hold, Marcus rarely nailed it when it came to the specifics. As a start, Marcus largely straw-manned the specific evolutionary psychology arguments. Each time he picked a human trait to critique, the arguments were vague and lacked detail. For example, in the discussion of whether mental illness could have an evolutionary advantage (thus explaining its ongoing presence), he refers to:

> the somewhat dubious suggestion that schizophrenia might have been selected for by natural selection because of a purported benefit that visions conveyed to tribal shamans, but there are many others.
>
>... If you're like me, you won't find these examples particularly compelling. Were schizophrenics really more likely than other people to become shamans? Were those who became shamans more successful than their non-schizophrenic counterparts in producing viable offspring? Even if they were, are shamans prevalent enough in history to explain why at least 1 in every 100 humans suffers from the disorder?

Fair questions, but that's it. No discussion of the rich literature on the topic (which in fairness to Marcus has become much richer since he wrote his book. Read Marco del Giudice's [Evolutionary Psychopathology](https://marcodg.net/evolutionary-psychopathology/) as an illustration.)

He also doesn't often establish that the problem is a 'kluge'. Most chapters end with a hand-wavy statement about how a more recent deliberative system is bolted onto a reflexive ancient system (the System 1 - System 2 dichotomy made famous by Kahenman).

Marcus also has an interesting definition of optimality, which largely consists of what he believes he could build with a computer. For instance, the benchmark against which our fallible memories is compared is "postal-code memory", where a computer assigns an address to each memory, and when it needs to access it it simply goes there. He states that "Having postal-code memory would have been terrifically useful for us, but evolution never discovered the
right part of the mountain range."

This benchmark of perfection, however, does not acknowledge any of the trade-offs, trade-offs that have become apparent in the world of generative AI. Generative AI that simply memorises it useless. It overfits the data. You want generative AI that generalises.

There is evidence

A discussion of trade-offs, for one, would be interesting.

Ultimately, Marcus has set a benchmark for humans based on computers, but it's one that even computers don't seem able to achieve. His critique of generative AI makes sense here - he has an impossible standard that doesn't grapple with the trade-offs.

Marcus also rarely engages the adaptationist argument on their terms - fitness. Almost concedes the point with schizophrenia.

In Chapter 4, he discusses how we make choices. Gigerenzer? Trade-offs.



From the perspective of 2025, Marcus's foundation of psychology research is outdated. Many of the experiments cited experiments have not replicated. Those included:

-  Priming people with words relating to the elderly [does not make them walk slower](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029081) (unless the person doing the timing was in on the experiment...).
-  Holding a pen between your teeth to force a smile [does not make a cartoon funnier](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691616674458).
-  Priming people with terms relating to professor - as opposed to soccer hooligan - [does not make them better at trivia](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691618755704).

Even those studies without the accompanying failed replication should be treated similarly. They come from an era where our [default should be disbelief]().

That said, if Marcus rewrote the book today, he could find enough experiments to back his point. It would have a very different feel however, with much of the novelty that made those experiments such great fodder of popular science books gone.

In the closing chapter Marcus offers us 13 ways to XXX. Chapters like this typically feel like a request from the publisher to end on a positive, practical note, and this is no exception. Running from banal to worth a try, unfortunately, however, you don't really need any of Marcus's Kluge framework to come up with this list.
