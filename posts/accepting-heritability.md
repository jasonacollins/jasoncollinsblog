<blockquote>[M]aybe some lefties do reject the heritability of IQ on ideological grounds. I want to make another point - that there's no need for them to do so. You can accept that IQ (or ability generally) is heritable and still be a strong egalitarian.

I say this because of a simple principle: luck egalitarianism. This says that inequalities are unjust if they are due to circumstances beyond one's control. If we grant that ability is inherited, then differences in ability are obviously a matter of luck. Insofar as these give rise to inequalities of income, a luck egalitarian can thus claim they are unjust.

...

That said, there is a sort of leftie who would be discombobulated by the heritability of ability. I'm thinking of that sort, like Tessa Jowell, who - in their optimism about the malleability of humankind - think that education can significantly reduce inequality.

But that leftism isn't mine. I agree with Ed Smith that social mobility - even if it could be achieved - is an unattractive ideal. It's no substitute for a just society.</blockquote>


Peter Singer made a related argument in *A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution, and Cooperation*, suggesting that the left needs to incorporate an updated understanding of the malleability of human nature into its framework - although Singer's arguments focused on our tendency to cooperate.

[Arnold Kling suggests](http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/heritability-left-and-right/) the discombobulation of some on the left comes from the need to maintain a narrative:


<blockquote>In the three-axes model, progressives want to squeeze every issue into an oppressor-oppressed narrative. To suggest that ethnic groups differ in average income for reasons other than oppression would be to weaken that narrative. So even if from a policy perspective a belief in heritability is tolerable, from a narrative perspective a book like _The Bell Curve_ represents a huge threat.

My sense is that this produces a great deal of cognitive dissonance on the left. I have many friends on the left, and I do not know a single one who would instinctively deny the heritability of intelligence. On the other hand, they have been instructed to regard Murray and Herrnstein as vile racists.</blockquote>


My own experience is that plenty of people are willing to argue whether behavioural traits are heritable. I sense Kling's narrative story is part of the reason, but I also suggest that it comes from a general unwillingness of people to concede any points in a debate. (Does this "bias" have a name - or is this just a manifestation of confirmation bias or a desire to reduce cognitive dissonance?)

Take arguments about climate change. Many libertarians or conservatives fight at every step of the way - the earth is not warming, the warming is not caused by human activity, the warming will be mild, the warming will be beneficial - all this before they get to arguments about the costs and benefits of different policy responses. Yet, whether warming is occurring or harmful would not seem to be a core part of the libertarian philosophy. Debates about heritability have a similar character.
