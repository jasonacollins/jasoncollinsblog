Links this week:

	
  1. [Ed Yong on Swarms](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/03/powers-of-swarms/all/).

	
  2. [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/business/economy/as-men-lose-economic-ground-clues-in-the-family.html) on whether the decline of two-parent households has caused the decline in male incomes. It still astounds me that some academics can discuss this without mentioning selection effects.

  3. [A critical review](http://www.paleostyle.com/?p=2131)Â by Miki Ben-Dor of [Marlene Zuk's Paleofantasy](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/zuks-paleofantasy/). On the flipside, Christina Warinner "[Debunking the paleo diet](http://youtu.be/BMOjVYgYaG8)".
